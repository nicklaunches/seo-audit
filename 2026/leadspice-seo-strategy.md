*Generated by https://x.com/nicklaunches, https://nicklaunches.com*

### 1. Current Situation (Quick Audit)
- **Strengths**:
  - 18 high-quality blog posts in ~2 months.
  - Strong content themes: "how-to" guides, 2026 updates, competitor comparisons (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Kaspr).
  - Perfect niche positioning: affordable AI lead cleaning + qualification for agencies & SaaS revenue teams.
  - Clean, fast design (no heavy bloat visible).

- **Quick Wins Needed**:
  - Home page missing meta description.
  - Blog meta description says "modern web development" (copy-paste error – fix immediately).
  - No clear pricing page
  - Limited internal linking from blog → product pages.
  - Very new domain → low authority (focus on content + links first).

### 2. SEO Goals (Next 6 Months)

### 5. Content Strategy (Your Biggest Lever)
You’re already doing this well, systematise it:

- **Pillar page** (create in March): "The Ultimate Guide to AI-Powered Lead Generation in 2026" (3,500+ words)
- **Cluster content** (2-3 posts/week):
  - Cold email deliverability 2026
  - How to build ICP with AI
  - Clay vs LeadSpice (you already have Reddit mentions – capitalise!)
